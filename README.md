# OnNight

On Night is an mobile application intended on helping students connect with Greek life social spaces better, allowing them to be notified about social events without having to rely on word of mouth.

## Architecture

We followed a standard MERN stack. The frontend has been built with React Native for mobile functionality. The backend was built with Node, Express, and MongoDB, which allows our app to store and retrieve data as necessary. Other relevant tools/platforms include: Mailgun and Heroku. 

## Setup

Backend (local): clone the repository, run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies, then run `npm start`
Backend (deployed): visit https://on-night-api.herokuapp.com/
Frontend (local): clone the repository, run `npm install` then `expo start`. The app can be viewed via links provided in the terminal or on your phone via the Expo app (QR code scan).
Frontend (deployed): refer to frontend repository instructions for further details 

## Deployment

The backend server has been deployed here: https://on-night-api.herokuapp.com/
